## Additional guidance for the training pipeline

### Optimizing the input pipeline

***Summary:*** *The causes and interventions of input-bound pipelines are highly
task-dependent; use a profiler and look out for common issues.*

-   Use an appropriate profiler to diagnose input-bound pipelines. For example,
    [Perfetto](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/profiling.html) for JAX or
    [TensorFlow profiler](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler) for
    TensorFlow.
-   Ultimately, the specific causes and interventions will be highly
    task-dependent. Broader engineering considerations (e.g. minimizing disk
    footprint) may warrant worse input pipeline performance.
-   Common causes:
    -   Data are not colocated with the training process, causing I/O latency
        (this might happen when reading training data over a network).
    -   Expensive online data preprocessing (consider doing this once offline
        and saving).
    -   Unintentional synchronization barriers that interfere with data pipeline
        prefetching. For example, when synchronizing metrics between the device
        and host in CommonLoopUtils
        ([link](https://github.com/google/CommonLoopUtils/blob/fea2518ada8814a78e1492023fd9f00edb0b0568/clu/metrics.py#L291)).
-   Common tips:
    -   Instrument input pipeline to prefetch examples (e.g.
        [tf.data.Dataset.prefetch](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance#prefetching))
    -   Remove unused features/metadata from each as early in the pipeline as
        possible.
    -   Increase the replication of the number of jobs generating examples for
        the input pipeline. For example, by using the
        [tf.data service](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/service).

### Evaluating model performance

***Summary:*** *Run evaluation at larger batch sizes than training. Run
evaluations at regular step intervals, not regular time intervals.*

#### Evaluation settings

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>

<br>

-   There are several settings in which we can evaluate the performance of our
    models.
    -   **Online evaluation** - metrics are collected when the model is serving
        predictions in a production environment.
    -   **Offline evaluation** - metrics are collected when the model is run on
        offline train/validation/test sets that are representative of the
        production environment.
    -   **Periodic evaluations** - metrics are collected during model training
        that might either be a proxy for the offline evaluation, and/or on a
        subset of the data used in offline evaluation.
-   Online evaluation is the gold standard, but is often impractical during the
    model development phase.
-   Depending on the problem, offline evaluation can be fairly involved and
    computationally expensive.
-   Periodic evaluations are the most practical and economical choice, but may
    not fully represent the production environment.
    -   Our goal during periodic evaluation is to use an expedient proxy of the
        offline evaluation, without sacrificing the reliability of the signal we
        get during training.

</details>

#### Setting up periodic evaluations

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>

<br>

-   We run periodic evaluations during training to monitor its progress in real
    time, to
    [facilitate retrospective model checkpoint selection](#saving-checkpoints-and-retrospectively-selecting-the-best-checkpoint),
    and so that we can
    [examine the training curves at the end of training](#examining-the-training-curves).
-   The simplest configuration is to perform both training and periodic
    evaluations within the same compute instance, periodically alternating
    between training and evaluation.
    -   In this case, the batch size used to perform evaluations should be *at
        least* as large as the batch size used for training because model
        activations don't need to be maintained during evaluation, lowering the
        computational requirements per example.
-   Periodic evaluations should be done at regular step intervals, not time
    intervals.
    -   Evaluating based on time intervals can make it harder to interpret the
        training curves, especially when training may suffer from preemptions of
        the training jobs, network latency issues, etc.
-   Periodicity in valid/test metrics (when using a shuffled
    train/validation/test split) can indicate implementation bugs such as test
    data having overlap with training data, or training data not being properly
    shuffled. Evaluating at regular step intervals can make these issues easier
    to catch.
-   Partial batches can occur when the evaluation sets are not divisible by the
    batch size. Ensure that the padded examples are correctly weighed to prevent
    the loss function from being biased by them. Often, these padded examples
    can be given a weight of zero.
-   Save sufficient information per evaluation to support offline analysis.
    Ideally, we would save predictions on a selection of individual examples
    since they can be invaluable for debugging.
    -   Generating artifacts like
        [SavedModels](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model) make it easy
        to do ad-hoc model inspection after evaluation jobs finish.

#### Choosing a sample for periodic evaluation

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>

<br>

-   The periodic evaluation job might not run fast enough to compute metrics on
    the full offline evaluation set in a reasonable amount of time. This often
    necessitates sampling data for periodic evaluation.
-   We consider the following factors when constructing a sampled dataset:
    -   <ins>Sample size</ins>
        -   Check that the performance computed on the sampled dataset used by
            the periodic job matches the performance on the whole offline
            evaluation set, i.e. there is no skew between the sampled set and
            the full dataset.
        -   The dataset used for periodic evaluation should be small enough that
            it’s easy to generate model predictions over its entirety, but large
            enough that improvements to the model can be accurately measured
            (i.e. not overwhelmed by label noise).
        -   It should be large enough to accommodate multiple such evaluations
            across trials in sequence, and still produce accurate estimates.
            That is, to avoid adaptively "fitting" to the validation set over
            time, in a way that doesn't generalize to a held-out test set.
            However, this consideration is rarely a practical concern.
    -   <ins>Imbalanced datasets</ins>
        -   For imbalanced datasets, performance on rare classes of examples
            will often be noisy.
        -   For datasets with a small number of examples in a class label, log
            the number of examples predicted correctly to get more insight into
            accuracy improvements (.05 sensitivity improvement sounds exciting,
            but was it just one more example correct?).

### Saving checkpoints and retrospectively selecting the best checkpoint

***Summary:*** *Run training for a fixed number of steps and retrospectively
choose the best checkpoint from the run.*

-   Most deep learning frameworks support
    [model checkpointing](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/flax.training.html).
    That is, the current state of the model is periodically preserved on disk.
    This allows the training job to be resilient to compute instance
    interruptions.
-   The best checkpoint is often not the last checkpoint, particularly when the
    validation set performance does not continue to increase over time but
    rather fluctuates about a particular value.
-   Set up the pipeline to keep track of the N best checkpoints seen so far
    during training. At the end of training, model selection is then a matter of
    choosing the best checkpoint seen during training. We call this
    **retrospective optimal checkpoint selection**.
-   Supporting prospective early stopping is usually not necessary, since we’re
    pre-specifying a trial budget and are preserving the N best checkpoints seen
    so far.

### Setting up experiment tracking

***Summary:*** *When tracking different experiments, make sure to note a number
of essentials like the best performance of a checkpoint in the study, and a
short description of the study.*

-   We've found that keeping track of experiment results in a spreadsheet has
    been helpful for the sorts of modeling problems we've worked on. It often
    has the following columns:
    -   Study name
    -   A link to wherever the config for the study is stored.
    -   Notes or a short description of the study.
    -   Number of trials run
    -   Performance on the validation set of the best checkpoint in the study.
    -   Specific reproduction commands or notes on what unsubmitted changes were
        necessary to launch training.
-   Find a tracking system that captures at least the information listed above
    and is convenient for the people doing it. Untracked experiments might as
    well not exist.

### Batch normalization implementation details

***Summary:*** *Nowadays batch norm can often be replaced with LayerNorm, but in
cases where it cannot, there are tricky details when changing the batch size or
number of hosts.*

-   Batch norm normalizes activations using their mean and variance over the
    current batch, but in the multi-device setting these statistics are
    different on each device unless explicitly synchronized.
-   Anecdotal reports (mostly on ImageNet) say calculating these normalizing
    statistics using only ~64 examples actually works better in practice (see
    Ghost Batch Norm from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08741)).
-   Decoupling the total batch size and the number of examples used to calculate
    batch norm statistics is particularly useful for batch size comparisons.
-   Ghost batch norm implementations do not always correctly handle the case
    where the per-device batch size > virtual batch size. In this case we'd
    actually need to subsample the batch on each device in order to get the
    proper number of batch norm statistic examples.
-   Exponential moving averages used in test mode batch norm are just a linear
    combination of training statistics, so these EMAs only need to be
    synchronized before saving them in checkpoints. However, some common
    implementations of batch norm do not synchronize these EMAs and only save
    the EMA from the first device.

### Considerations for multi-host pipelines

***Summary:*** *for logging, evals, RNGs, checkpointing, and data sharding,
multi-host training can make it very easy to introduce bugs!*

-   Ensure the pipeline is only logging and checkpointing on one host.
-   Make sure before evaluation or checkpointing is run, the batch norm
    statistics are synchronized across hosts.
-   It is critical to have RNG seeds that are the same across hosts (for model
    initialization), and seeds that are different across hosts (for data
    shuffling/preprocessing), so make sure to mark them appropriately.
-   Sharding data files across hosts is usually recommended for improved
    performance.
