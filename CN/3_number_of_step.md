## Determining the number of steps for each training run

-   There are two types of workloads: those that are compute-bound and those
    that are not.
-   When training is **compute-bound**, training is limited by how long we are
    willing to wait and not by how much training data we have or some other
    factor.
    -   In this case, if we can somehow train longer or more efficiently, we
        should see a lower training loss and, with proper tuning, an improved
        validation loss.
    -   In other words, *speeding up* training is equivalent to *improving*
        training and the "optimal" training time is always "as long as we can
        afford."
    -   That said, just because a workload is compute-limited doesn't mean
        training longer/faster is the only way to improve results.
-   When training is **not compute-bound**, we can afford to train as long as we
    would like to, and, at some point, training longer doesn't help much (or
    even causes problematic overfitting).
    -   In this case, we should expect to be able to train to very low training
        loss, to the point where training longer might slightly reduce the
        training loss, but will not meaningfully reduce the validation loss.
    -   Particularly when training is not compute-bound, a more generous
        training time budget can make tuning easier, especially when tuning
        learning rate decay schedules, since they have a particularly strong
        interaction with the training budget.
        -   In other words, very stingy training time budgets might require a
            learning rate decay schedule tuned to perfection in order to achieve
            a good error rate.
-   Regardless of whether a given workload is compute-bound or not, methods that
    increase the variance of the gradients (across batches) will usually result
    in slower training progress, and thus may increase the number of training
    steps required to reach a particular validation loss. High gradient variance
    can be caused by:
    -   Using a smaller batch size
    -   Adding data augmentation
    -   Adding some types of regularization (e.g. dropout)

### Deciding how long to train when training is *not* compute-bound

-   Our main goal is to ensure we are training long enough for the model to
    reach the best possible result, while avoiding being overly wasteful in the
    number of training steps.
-   When in doubt, err on the side of training longer. Performance should never
    degrade when training longer, assuming retrospective (optimal) checkpoint
    selection is used properly and checkpoints are frequent enough.
-   Never tune the `max_train_steps` number in a study. Pick a value and use it
    for all trials. From these trials, plot the training step that retrospective
    checkpoint selection finds in order to refine the choice of
    `max_train_steps`.
    -   For example, if the best step is always during the first 10% of
        training, then the maximum number of steps is way too high.
    -   Alternatively, if the best step is consistently in the last 25% of
        training we might benefit from training longer and re-tuning the decay
        schedule.
-   The ideal number of training steps can change when the architecture or data
    changes (e.g. adding data augmentation).
-   Below we describe how to pick an initial candidate value for
    `max_train_steps` based on the number of steps necessary to "perfectly fit"
    the training set using a constant learning rate.
    -   Note, we are not using the phrase "perfectly fit the training set" in a
        precise or mathematically well-defined way. It is merely meant as an
        informal descriptor to indicate a very low training loss.
        -   For example, when training with the log loss, absent regularization
            terms, we might see the training loss keep slowly improving until we
            reach floating point limits as the network weights grow without
            bound and the predictions of the model on the training set become
            increasingly confident. In this case, we might say the model
            "perfectly fit" the training set around the time the
            misclassification error reached zero on the training set.
    -   The starting value for `max_train_steps` we find may need to be
        increased if the amount of gradient noise in the training procedure
        increases.
        -   For example, if data augmentation or regularizers like dropout are
            introduced to the model.
    -   It may be possible to decrease `max_train_steps` if the training process
        improves somehow.
        -   For example, with a better tuned optimizer or a better tuned
            learning rate schedule.

#### Algorithm for picking an initial candidate for max_train_steps using a learning rate sweep

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>

<br>

-   This procedure assumes it is possible to not only "perfectly" fit the
    training set, but to do so using a constant learning rate schedule.
-   If it is possible to perfectly fit the entire training set, then there must
    exist a configuration (with some value of `max_train_steps`) that perfectly
    fits the training set; find any such configuration and use its value of
    `max_train_steps` as a starting point `N`.
-   Run a constant learning rate sweep (i.e. grid search the learning rate)
    without data augmentation and without regularization where each trial trains
    for `N` steps.
-   The number of steps required for the fastest trial in the sweep to reach
    perfect training performance is our initial guess for `max_train_steps`.
-   **NOTE:** Bad search spaces can make it possible to engage in
    self-deception.
    -   For example, if all the learning rates in a study are too small, we
        might incorrectly conclude that a very large value of `max_train_steps`
        is necessary.
    -   At a minimum, we should check that the optimal learning rate in the
        study is not at the boundary of the search space.

### Deciding how long to train when training is compute-bound

-   In some cases, training loss keeps improving indefinitely and our patience
    and computational resources become the limiting factors.
-   If training loss (or even validation loss) keeps improving indefinitely,
    should we always train as long as we can afford? Not necessarily.
    -   We might be able to tune more effectively by running a larger number of
        shorter experiments and reserving the longest "production length" runs
        for the models we hope to launch.
    -   As the training time for trials approaches our patience limit, tuning
        experiments become more relevant for our potential launch candidates,
        but we can complete fewer of them.
    -   There are probably many questions we can answer while only training for
        ~10% of the production length, but there is always a risk that our
        conclusions at this time limit will not apply to experiments at 20% of
        the production length, let alone 100%.
-   Tuning in multiple rounds with increasing, per-trial training step limits is
    a sensible approach.
    -   We can do as many rounds as we want, but usually 1-3 are the most
        practical.
    -   Essentially, try to obtain as much understanding of the problem as
        possible using trials with a very quick turnaround time, trading off
        tuning thoroughness with relevance to the final, longest runs.
    -   Once a given per-trial time limit has generated useful insights, we can
        increase the training time and continue tuning, double-checking our
        conclusions from the shorter runs as needed.
-   As a starting point, we recommend two rounds of tuning:
    -   Round 1: Shorter runs to find good model and optimizer hyperparameters.
    -   Round 2: Very few long runs on good hyperparameter points to get the
        final model.
-   The biggest question going from `Round i` &rarr; `Round i+1` is how to
    adjust learning rate decay schedules.
    -   One common pitfall when adjusting learning rate schedules between rounds
        is using all the extra training steps with too small of a learning rate.

#### Round 1

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>

<br>

-   Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that good hyperparameters found in
    short, incomplete training are still good choices when training length is
    significantly increased. However, for some kinds of hyperparameters, they
    are often correlated enough for Round 1 to be useful.
-   What hyperparameter values found in shorter runs do we expect to transfer to
    longer training runs? For all of this, we need more research. But based on
    what we know so far, here are the authors’ suspicions in order of decreasing
    probability of transferring:
    -   Very likely to transfer
        -   Early training instability can be resolved in the first round of
            tuning using a smaller number of training steps. Perhaps these
            hyperparameters are the closest thing to a sure bet for transfer
            that we have.
            -   Warmup length
            -   Initialization
    -   Likely to transfer
        -   Model architecture - A dramatic win in the model architecture will
            usually transfer, but there are probably many counterexamples.
    -   Might transfer
        -   Optimization algorithm/optimizer hyperparameters - We think this
            would "loosely" transfer. It’s definitely weaker than the things
            above it.
        -   Data augmentation
        -   Regularization
            -   If it isn't possible to perfectly fit the training set, the
                model might be in a regime where regularization is unlikely to
                help very much.
    -   Unlikely to transfer
        -   Learning rate schedule: unlikely to transfer perfectly.
            -   [This paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556) suggests that
                even decay schedule transfers, but we don't believe this is true
                in general. Example: Tuning sqrt decay on small # of training
                steps then extending to large # will result in the majority of
                training occurring at overly small steps.
                -   One can likely do "good enough" with most schedules in the
                    limit of extreme training budget, but noticeable performance
                    improvements can likely be seen if it is tuned.
            -   [Understanding Short-Horizon Bias in Stochastic
                Meta-Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02021) describes
                the dangers of trying to pick learning rates myopically.

</details>

#### Round 2

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>

<br>

-   Run the best hyperparameter configuration from Round 1.
-   **(Speculation)** 🤖 Use the extra steps to extend the period of training at
    a high learning rate.
    -   E.g. if linear schedule then keep the length of the decay fixed from
        Round 1 and extend the period of constant lr in the beginning.
    -   For cosine decay, just keep the base lr from Round 1 and extend
        `max_train_steps` as in
        [Chinchilla paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556).
-   More rounds might make sense for teams with very mature modeling and tuning
    pipelines and very long and expensive production training runs, but they
    will often be overkill.
    -   We've described how to transfer from Step 1 &rarr; Step 2. If we didn't care
        about analysis time and if making efficient use of compute was the
        overriding concern, then the ideal would be to exponentially increase
        the length of training runs (and thus the end-to-end time to complete a
        study) over many different rounds of tuning.
        -   At each round we systematically ensure our choices continue to hold
            up.
        -   New ideas go through a pipeline that progressively derisks them
            using increasingly long-running experiments from Step i to Step i+1.

## FAQs

### What is the best learning rate decay schedule family?

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>

<br>

-   It’s an open problem. It’s not clear how to construct a set of rigorous
    experiments to confidently answer what the "best" LR decay schedule is.
-   Although we don't know the best schedule family, we're confident that it’s
    important to have some (non-constant) schedule and that tuning it matters.
-   Different learning rates work best at different times during the
    optimization process. Having some sort of schedule makes it more likely for
    the model to hit a good learning rate.

</details>

### Which learning rate decay should I use as a default?

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>
<br>

-   Our preference is either linear decay or cosine decay, and a bunch of other
    schedule families are probably good too.

</details>

### Why do some papers have complicated learning rate schedules?

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>
<br>

-   It’s not uncommon to see papers with complicated piecewise learning rate
    (LR) decay schedules.
-   Readers often wonder how the authors arrived at such a complicated study.
-   Many complicated LR decay schedules are the result of tuning the schedule as
    a function of the validation set performance in an ad hoc way:
    1.  Start a single training run with some simple LR decay (or a constant
        learning rate).
    2.  Keep training running until the performance seems to stagnate. If this
        happens, pause training. Resume it with a perhaps steeper LR decay
        schedule (or smaller constant learning rate) from this point. Repeat
        this process until the conference/launch deadline.
-   Blithely copying the resulting *schedule* is generally not a good idea since
    the best particular schedule will be sensitive to a host of other
    hyperparameter choices.
    -   Better to copy the *algorithm* that produced the schedule, although this
        is rarely possible when arbitrary human judgment produced the schedule.
-   This type of validation-error-sensitive schedule is fine to use if it can be
    fully automated, but human-in-the-loop schedules that are a function of
    validation error are brittle and not easily reproducible, so we recommend
    avoiding them.
    -   Before publishing results that used such a schedule, please try to make
        it fully reproducible.

</details>

### How should Adam’s hyperparameters be tuned?

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>
<br>

-   As discussed above, making general statements about search spaces and how
    many points one should sample from the search space is very difficult. Note
    that not all the hyperparameters in Adam are equally important. The
    following rules of thumb correspond to different "budgets" for the number of
    trials in a study.
    -   If < 10 trials in a study, only tune the (base) learning rate.
    -   If 10-25 trials, tune learning rate and $\beta_1$.
    -   If 25+ trials, tune the learning rate, $\beta_1$ and $\epsilon$.
    -   If one can run substantially more than 25 trials, additionally tune
        $\beta_2$.

</details>

### Why use quasi-random search instead of more sophisticated black box optimization algorithms during the exploration phase of tuning?

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>

-   Quasi-random search (based on
    [low-discrepancy sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-discrepancy_sequence))
    is our preference over fancier black box optimization tools when used as
    part of an iterative tuning process intended to maximize insight into the
    tuning problem (what we refer to as the "exploration phase"). Bayesian
    optimization and similar tools are more appropriate for the exploitation
    phase.
-   Quasi-random search based on randomly shifted low-discrepancy sequences can
    be thought of as "jittered, shuffled grid search", since it uniformly, but
    randomly, explores a given search space and spreads out the search points
    more than random search.
-   The advantages of quasi-random search over more sophisticated black box
    optimization tools (e.g. Bayesian optimization, evolutionary algorithms)
    include:
    1.  Sampling the search space non-adaptively makes it possible to change the
        tuning objective in post hoc analysis without rerunning experiments.
        -   For example, we usually want to find the best trial in terms of
            validation error achieved at any point in training. But the
            non-adaptive nature of quasi-random search makes it possible to find
            the best trial based on final validation error, training error, or
            some alternative evaluation metric without rerunning any
            experiments.
    2.  Quasi-random search behaves in a consistent and statistically
        reproducible way.
        -   It should be possible to reproduce a study from six months ago even
            if the implementation of the search algorithm changes, as long as it
            maintains the same uniformity properties. If using sophisticated
            Bayesian optimization software, the implementation might change in
            an important way between versions, making it much harder to
            reproduce an old search. It isn’t always possible to roll back to an
            old implementation (e.g. if the optimization tool is run as a
            service).
    3.  Its uniform exploration of the search space makes it easier to reason
        about the results and what they might suggest about the search space.
        -   For example, if the best point in the traversal of quasi-random
            search is at the boundary of the search space, this is a good (but
            not foolproof) signal that the search space bounds should be
            changed. [This section](#identifying-bad-search-space-boundaries)
            goes into more depth. However, an adaptive black box optimization
            algorithm might have neglected the middle of the search space
            because of some unlucky early trials even if it happens to contain
            equally good points, since it is this exact sort of non-uniformity
            that a good optimization algorithm needs to employ to speed up the
            search.
    4.  Running different numbers of trials in parallel versus sequentially will
        not produce statistically different results when using quasi-random
        search (or other non-adaptive search algorithms), unlike with adaptive
        algorithms.
    5.  More sophisticated search algorithms may not always handle infeasible
        points correctly, especially if they aren't designed with neural network
        hyperparameter tuning in mind.
    6.  Quasi-random search is simple and works especially well when many tuning
        trials will be running in parallel.
        -   Anecdotally[^3], it is very hard for an adaptive algorithm to beat a
            quasi-random search that has 2X its budget, especially when many
            trials need to be run in parallel (and thus there are very few
            chances to make use of previous trial results when launching new
            trials).
        -   Without expertise in Bayesian optimization and other advanced black
            box optimization methods, we might not achieve the benefits they
            are, in principle, capable of providing. It is hard to benchmark
            advanced black box optimization algorithms in realistic deep
            learning tuning conditions. They are a very active area of current
            research, and the more sophisticated algorithms come with their own
            pitfalls for inexperienced users. Experts in these methods are able
            to get good results, but in high-parallelism conditions the search
            space and budget tend to matter a lot more.
-   That said, if our computational resources only allow a small number of
    trials to run in parallel and we can afford to run many trials in sequence,
    Bayesian optimization becomes much more attractive despite making our tuning
    results harder to interpret.

[^3]: Ben Recht and Kevin Jamieson
    [pointed out](http://www.argmin.net/2016/06/20/hypertuning/) how strong
    2X-budget random search is as a baseline (the
    [Hyperband paper](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-558/16-558.pdf)
    makes similar arguments), but it is certainly possible to find search
    spaces and problems where state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization
    techniques crush random search that has 2X the budget. However, in our
    experience beating 2X-budget random search gets much harder in the
    high-parallelism regime since Bayesian optimization has no opportunity to
    observe the results of previous trials.

### Where can I find an implementation of quasi-random search?

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>
<br>

-   [Open-Source Vizier](https://github.com/google/vizier) has an [implementation
    of quasi-ranom search](https://github.com/google/vizier/blob/main/vizier/_src/algorithms/designers/quasi_random.py). Set `algorithm="QUASI_RANDOM_SEARCH"` in [this usage example](https://oss-vizier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/user/running_vizier.html).
-   An alternative implementation exists
    [here](https://github.com/mlcommons/algorithmic-efficiency/blob/main/algorithmic_efficiency/halton.py).
-   Both implementations above generate a Halton sequence for a given search space (intended to
    implement a shifted, scrambled Halton sequence as recommended in
    https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03200).
-   If a quasi-random search algorithm based on a low-discrepancy sequence is
    not available, it is possible to substitute pseudo random uniform search
    instead, although this is likely to be slightly less efficient.
    -   In 1-2 dimensions, grid search is also acceptable, although not in
        higher dimensions (see
        [Bergstra & Bengio, 2012](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v13/bergstra12a.html)).

### How many trials are needed to get good results with quasi-random search?

</p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 3:</b> A ResNet-50 was tuned on ImageNet with 100
trials. Via bootstrapping, different amounts of tuning budget were simulated.
Box plots of the best performances for each trial budget are plotted above.

-   There is no way to answer this question in general, but we can look at
    specific examples.
-   As the Figure 3 shows, the number of trials in a study can have a
    substantial impact on the results.
    -   Notice how large the interquartile ranges are when 6 trials were
        sampled, versus when 20 trials were sampled.
    -   Even with 20 trials, it is likely that the difference between especially
        lucky and unlucky studies will be larger than the typical variation
        between re-trains of this model on different random seeds, with fixed
        hyperparameters, which for this workload might be around +/- 0.1% on a
        validation error rate of \~23%.

### How can optimization failures be debugged and mitigated?

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>
<br>


***Summary:*** *If the model is experiencing optimization difficulties, it’s
important to fix them before trying other things. Diagnosing and correcting
training failures is an active area of research.*

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/stride_instability.png" width="80%" alt="Changing the strides in a single residual block in a WideResnet results in training instability.">
</p>


<p align="center"><b>Figure 4:</b> Changing the strides in a single residual block (2x2 -> 1x1) in a WideResnet results in training instability. This does not degrade performance at low learning rates, but high learning rates no longer train well due to the instability. Applying 1000 steps of learning rate warmup resolves this particular instance of instability, allowing stable training at max learning rate of .1.</p>

#### Identifying unstable workloads

-   Any workload will become unstable if the learning rate is too large.
    Instability is only an issue when it forces us to use a learning rate that’s
    too small.
-   There are at least two types of training instability worth distinguishing:
    1.  Instability at initialization/early in training.
    2.  Sudden instability in the middle of training.
-   We can take a systematic approach to identifying stability issues in our
    workload.
    1.  Do a learning rate sweep and find the best learning rate lr*.
    2.  Plot training loss curves for learning rates just above lr*.
    3.  If the learning rates > lr* show loss instability (loss goes up not down
        during periods of training), then it is likely that fixing the
        instability will result in better training.
-   Log the L2 norm of the full loss gradient during training, outlier values
    can result in spurious instability in the middle of training. This can
    inform how to pick gradient/update clipping.

**NOTE:** Some models show very early instability followed by a recovery that
results in slow but stable training. **Common evaluation schedules can miss
these issues by not evaluating frequently enough!**

To check for this, we can train for an abbreviated run of just \~500 steps using
`lr = 2 * current best`, but evaluate every step.

training.">
</p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 5:</b> Illustration of the value of more frequent evaluations at the start of training. Useful if there’s a suspicion that the model suffers from early training instability.</p>

#### Potential fixes for common instability patterns

-   Apply learning rate warmup
    -   Best for early training instability.
-   Apply gradient clipping
    -   Good for both early and mid training instability, may fix some bad inits
        that warmup cannot.
-   Try a new optimizer
    -   Sometimes Adam can handle instabilities that Momentum can’t. This is an
        active area of research.
-   We can ensure that we’re using best practices/initializations for our model
    architecture (examples below).
    -   Add residual connections and normalization if the model doesn't contain
        it already.
-   Normalization should be the last operation before the residual. E.g. x +
    Norm(f(x)).
-   Norm(x + f(x)) known to cause issues.
-   Try initializing residual branches to 0 (e.g.
    [ReZero init](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04887)).
-   Lower the learning rate
    -   This is a last resort.

<p align="center"><b>Figure 7b:</b> The training loss of a model trained with a learning rate where we see instability.</p>

-   Figure 7a shows a hyperparameter axis plot that indicates a model
    experiencing optimization instabilities, because the best learning rate is
    right at the edge of instability.
-   Figure 7b shows how this can be double-checked by examining the training
    loss of a model trained with a learning rate either 5x or 10x larger than
    this peak. If that plot shows a sudden rise in the loss after a steady
    decline (e.g. at step \~10k in the figure above), then the model likely
    suffers from optimization instability.

##### How to apply learning rate warmup

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/beneficial_effect_warmup.png" width="80%" alt="Beneficial effect of warmup on training instabilities">
</p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 8:</b> Beneficial effect of learning rate warmup on addressing training instabilities.</p>

-   Using the section immediately above, we assume that the practitioner has
    already identified the learning rate at which the model becomes unstable.
    This is the `unstable_base_learning_rate`.
-   Warmup involves prepending a learning rate schedule that ramps up the
    learning rate from 0 to some stable `base_learning_rate`, that is at least
    one order of magnitude larger than `unstable_base_learning_rate`. The
    default would be to try a `base_learning_rate` that’s 10x
    `unstable_base_learning_rate`. Although note that it’d be possible to run
    this entire procedure again for something like 100x
    `unstable_base_learning_rate`. The specific schedule is:
    -   Ramp up from 0 to `base_learning_rate` over `warmup_steps`.
    -   Train at a constant rate for `post_warmup_steps`.
-   Our goal is to find the shortest number of `warmup_steps` that allows us to
    access peak learning rates that are much higher than
    `unstable_base_learning_rate`.
-   So for each `base_learning_rate`, we need to tune `warmup_steps` and
    `post_warmup_steps`. It’s usually fine to set `post_warmup_steps` to be
    `2*warmup_steps`.
-   Warmup can be tuned independently of an existing decay schedule.
    `warmup_steps` should be swept at a few different orders of magnitude. For
    example, an example study could try [10, 10<sup>3</sup>, 10<sup>4</sup>,
    10<sup>5</sup>]. The largest feasible point shouldn't be more than 10% of
    `max_train_steps`.
-   Once a `warmup_steps` that doesn't blow up training at `base_learning_rate`
    has been established, it should be applied to the baseline model.
    Essentially, we prepend this schedule onto the existing schedule, and use
    the optimal checkpoint selection discussed above to compare this experiment
    to the baseline. For example, if we originally had 10,000 `max_train_steps`
    and did `warmup_steps` for 1000 steps, the new training procedure should run
    for 11,000 steps total.
-   If long `warmup_steps` are required for stable training (>5% of
    `max_train_steps`), `max_train_steps` may need to be increased to account
    for this.
-   There isn't really a "typical" value across the full range of workloads.
    Some models only need 100 steps, while others (particularly transformers)
    may need 40k+.

#### Gradient clipping

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/gradient_clipping.png" width="80%" alt="Gradient clipping on early training instabilities">
</p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 9:</b> Illustration of gradient clipping correcting early training instability.</p>

-   Gradient clipping is most useful when large or outlier gradient issues
    occur.
-   Clipping can fix either early training instability (large gradient norm
    early), or mid training instabilities (sudden gradient spikes mid training).
-   Sometimes longer warmup periods can correct instabilities that clipping does
    not: see [this section above](#How-to-apply-learning-rate-warmup).
    -   🤖 What about clipping during warmup?
-   The ideal clip thresholds are just above the "typical" gradient norm.
-   Here’s an example of how gradient clipping could be done:
    -   If the norm of the gradient $\left | g \right |$ is greater than the
        gradient clipping threshold $\lambda$, then do ${g}'= \lambda \times \frac{g}{\left | g \right |}$ where ${g}'$ is the new gradient.
-   Log the unclipped gradient norm during training. By default, generate:
    -   A plot of gradient norm vs step
    -   A histogram of gradient norms aggregated over all steps
-   Choose a gradient clipping threshold based on the 90th percentile of
    gradient norms.
    -   The threshold will be workload dependent, but 90% is a good starting
        point. If it doesn't work, this threshold can be tuned.
    -   🤖 What about some sort of adaptive strategy?
-   If we try gradient clipping and the instability issues remain, we can try it
    harder (i.e. make the threshold smaller).
-   Extremely aggressive gradient clipping is in essence a strange way of
    reducing the learning rate. If we find ourselves using extremely aggressive
    clipping, we probably should just cut the learning rate instead.
-   We would usually consider having >50% of the updates getting clipped somehow
    as "extremely aggressive".
-   If we need to do extremely aggressive gradient clipping to deal with our
    instability issues, then we might as well reduce the learning rate.

### Why do you call the learning rate and other optimization parameters hyperparameters? They are not parameters of any prior distribution.

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>
<br>

-   It is true that the term "hyperparameter" has a precise
    [meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter) in Bayesian machine
    learning and referring to the learning rate and most of the other parameters
    we tune in deep learning as "hyperparameters" is an abuse of terminology.
-   We would prefer to use the term "metaparameter" for learning rates,
    architectural parameters, and all the other things we tune in deep learning,
    since it avoids the potential for confusion that comes from misusing the
    word "hyperparameter" (confusion that is especially likely when discussing
    Bayesian optimization where the probabilistic response surface models have
    their own true hyperparameters).
-   Unfortunately, although potentially confusing, the term hyperparameter has become
    extremely common in the deep learning community.
-   Therefore, for a document, such as this one, intended for a wide audience
    that includes many people who are unlikely to be aware of this technicality,
    we made the choice to contribute to one source of confusion in the
    field in hopes of avoiding another.
-   That said, we might make a different choice when publishing a research
    paper, and we would encourage others to use "metaparameter" instead in most
    contexts.

### Why shouldn't the batch size be tuned to directly improve validation set performance?

<details><summary><em>[Click to expand]</em></summary>
<br>

-   Changing the batch size *without changing any other details of the training pipeline* will often affect the validation set performance.
-   However, the difference in validation set performance between two batch sizes typically goes away if the training pipeline is optimized independently for each batch size.
-   The hyperparameters that interact most strongly with the batch size, and therefore are most important to tune separately for each batch size, are the optimizer hyperparameters (e.g. learning rate, momentum) and the regularization hyperparameters.
    - Smaller batch sizes introduce more noise into the training algorithm due to sample variance, and this noise can have a regularizing effect. Thus, larger batch sizes can be more prone to overfitting and may require stronger regularization and/or additional regularization techniques.
- In addition, [the number of training steps may need to be adjusted](#choosing-the-batch-size-to-minimize-training-time) when changing the batch size.
-   Once all these effects are taken into account, there is currently no convincing evidence that the batch size affects the maximum achievable validation performance (see [Shallue et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03600)).
